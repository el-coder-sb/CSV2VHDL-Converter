# CSV2VHDL-Converter
Reads csv-data and generates vhdl code (or do file code), to be used in a simulation.

My use case:
I save measurement data from an oscilloscope in csv format. With this script I convert the data to vhdl code, so I can use it in a simulation tool as input.

# Requirements
Python >= 3.6 (tested with 3.8)

# Use
change parameter in "if __name__ == '__main__':"
